Vercel deployment : https://bees-minh146.vercel.app/  

## Implementation Approach:
1. Requirement Analysis: Read through all the requirements to understand the overall functionalities, user interface, and specifications to choose appropriate frameworks and libraries.
2. Component Extraction: Identify any CSS or HTML that is used multiple times and extract it into reusable components to avoid code duplication.
4. Structure First: Start by structuring the HTML, then proceed to the CSS styling, followed by implementing the functionality and testing it. Finally, responsive and test responsive.
